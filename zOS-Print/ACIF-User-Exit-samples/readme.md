This directory contains sample code for ACIF, the Advanced Function
Printing Conversion and Indexing Function. It illustrates methods
for coding each of the ACIF exits (Input, Output, Index, and Resource),
and also shows a method of using the ACIF index file to index and
retrieve documents from archive files.

The programs documented here are examples intended to illustrate
the use of MO:DCA indexing. They are not intended as complete working
applications. For more information, please read the comments in the
example code.
